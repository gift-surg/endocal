# endocal

endocal is a cross-platform, compact GUI application for the optical distortion calibration of fluid-immersed endoscopes. It uses the [OpenCV][opencv] camera calibration module.

endocal was developed by Dzhoshkun I. Shakir as part of the [GIFT-Surg project][giftsurg] at the [Translational Imaging Group][tig] in the [Centre for Medical Image Computing][cmic] at [University College London (UCL)][ucl].

## Features

* Lightweight, compact GUI application for optical distortion calibration of endoscopes
* Command-line application for generating [ASCII DXF files](http://www.autodesk.com/techpubs/autocad/acadr14/dxf/) for use in calibration target fabrication (translated from Matlab scripts developed by Daniil I. Nikitichev)

## System requirements

* [Python][python]
* [pip][pip]
* [OpenCV][opencv] (installed with [Python][python] support)
* For live calibration: a video source supported by [OpenCV][opencv_docs] (see esp. the OpenCV tutorials related
 to video IO)
* [PyYAML][pyyaml]
* [NumPy][numpy]
* So far endocal has been tested on the following operating systems:

  - Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS 64-bit
  - Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS 64-bit
  - elementary OS Freya 0.3.2 64-bit
  - macOS Sierra 10.12.6
  - OS X El Capitan 10.11.3
  - Windows 10 Professional 64-bit

## Installation

**Note:** Please check out [these hints](doc/issues.md) if you encounter any issues with endocal.

To install: `pip install endocal`.

To test your installation type: `endocal-test`:

* See [this screenshot](endocal/res/screenshot-start.png) for what to expect on launching the application.
* To perform an optical distortion calibration, follow the instructions shown in red on top of the window. While acquiring calibration data, detected calibration pattern blobs will be emphasized with a virtual overlay as in [this screenshot](endocal/res/screenshot-detection.png).
* All data for each calibration will be saved in the sub-folder of a folder called `tmp-sample_002`, created within
the current folder. These include:
  * Calibration parameters saved as `calibration.yml`
  * Frames used for calibration saved as indexed image files, e.g. `frame_009.jpg`
* After performing a calibration, the application will automatically show the undistorted images to the right as shown in [this screenshot](endocal/res/screenshot-undistort.png).

To remove: `pip uninstall endocal`.

## How to use

**Calibration:** `endocal --help` shows details of what input parameters are expected. Examples include:
* Using all frames stored as indexed files e.g. `frame_009.jpg`:
```
endocal --pattern-specs 3 11 3 1 --output-folder ./calibration-results --input /data/offline/frame_%03d.jpg
```
* Using online video stream from a frame-grabber (attached to an endoscope) that is mounted as `/dev/video0` on Linux:
```
endocal --input 0 --pattern-specs 3 11 3 1 --output-folder ./calibration-results
```
* Using a `700 x 700` sub-frame of the whole endoscopic video frame (`1920 x 1080`):
```
endocal --input 0 --pattern-specs 3 11 3 1 --output-folder ./calibration-results --roi 620 200 700 700
```

**ASCII DXF file generation:** For instance to generate an asymmetric grid of circles each with a diameter of `1 mm` to be etched by a laser cutter with a beam width of `45 Î¼m` (microns):
```
dxf --laser-beam-width 45 --diameter 1 --output-file output.dxf
```
Here the grid is saved to file `output.dxf` and the corresponding (ellipse) legend to `output-legend.dxf` (legend filename always inferred from main DXF filename).
